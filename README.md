# Project 1 | Space Invaders Tournament

## The Game

This game is the first project created for webDevOpen's Full Stack Development certificate.  It would create a remixed version and tournament of **Space Invaders**.  It's goal here is to take something original and add the most juice into it.  I want the old Space Invaders game to be conceptually remembered, but I also want a new revamped game that I have created here to be shown off to future employers so that they can see my true abilities to work at my finest and my best.

## Coding and Implementation

It took 4 full days to code something like this in JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, and establish a good code base and structure.   Object-oriented programming was used in this game.

The object of the game is, basically, to shoot the invaders with your laser base (D) while avoiding their shots and preventing an invasion. Amassing a high score (F) is a further objective and one that must be prioritised against your continued survival. Each game screen starts with five rows of 11 invaders. The bottom 2 rows score 10 points per large invader (A), the middle 2 rows 20 points for each medium invader (B) and the top row scores 30 points for each small invader (C). This makes each screen worth a total of 990 points. The score for each screen can be dramatically increased by the tactical destruction of the 'mystery' value spaceships (G) that frequently fly from one side of the screen to the other. Temporary sanctuary can be sought beneath the 4 base shelters (E).

## Conclusion and Closing remarks

I had an absolutely fun experience programming this game with 732 lines of logic embedded inside pure Javascript.  Have fun playing!
