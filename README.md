A Space Invaders Remix created for webDevOpen

# Project 1 | Space Invaders The Remix

## Introduction

This game is the first project created for webDevOpen's Full Stack Development certificate.  It would create a remixed version of **Space Invaders**.  It's goal here is to take something original and add the most juice into it.  I want the old Space Invaders game to be conceptually remembered, but I also want a new revamped game that I have created here to be shown off to future employers so that they can see my true abilities to work at my finest and my best.
